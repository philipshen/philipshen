Listening to The Killers in the right environment will make you feel like a superhero. They’re very good at that. Despite the fact that they pump out a whole lot of songs in the 7-ish range, which makes their albums a little lackluster, they have enough awesome hits to merit a very high score from myself.

**Best Album:** *Hot Fuss* 

Duh. What a classic!

Their new album *Wonderful, Wonderful* was pretty meh in my opinion. The hit song from there, *The Man*, is meh. Not really to my taste. I do sort of like *Run for Cover*, though.

**Best Song:** *Mr. Brightside*

Also a duh from me. Although, they do have plenty of other jammers in the 9-9.5 range, so maybe not quite as hard of a “duh”. Regardless, *Mr. Brightside* is, for me, their best song by a pretty wide margin.
