Well, this my first time writing one of these notes. Inspired by my brother and how he writes about the books that he finishes, I have decided to do the same––not just for books, but also for TV shows, bands, and all the other things that I am keeping completion logs for. It will be nice to be able to look back on my notes about them. It could make for a nice project too; a web app to keep these in, that is. Like a blog.

Anyways, here’s article one on Pink Floyd. They’ve been my favorite band since I’ve gotten into music. They're really cool. Why? I'm not totally sure. Hopefully as I continue to write these things I learn more about my own tastes and music in general. I guess in a sentence, it's very easy to get lost in the music listening to them. Which is a great thing. Really is. I’ve spent many a burnt-out evening sitting on the balcony looking at my nice view of High-Tech Park, beer in hand, eating an apple, and listening to *The Wall*.

Which, by the way, is my favorite album ever. None of the songs really work as stand-alone songs, to be put in a playlist or whatever, which is pretty characteristic of Pink Floyd, but as an album it just comes together in a way that’s absolute madness.

Pink Floyd has 2 of my 3 favorite songs––*Wish You Were Here* and *Comfortably Numb* ––and my 2 favorite albums (*The Wall* and *Wish You Were Here*). Also I should prob note that my ratings aren’t based on any sort of formal knowledge about music or science or anthing, they’re pretty much just of a measure of how much I like things.

The reason for their big spread is because they’ve gone through some big changes, not because they’re inconsistent. In the 70s there they were just pumping out bangers and jams, but their new stuff is pretty boring and their older stuff is pretty hit or miss with me.

Here are my favorite songs and albums of theirs.
