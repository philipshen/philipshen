## Preface

> I saw that Agile software development was the practical implication of treating software teams and projects as complex systems

This basically sets up the entire book: exploring how to manage teams of developers by viewing the situation as a complex system, and then proceeding scientifically

> One important insight is that all organizations are networks. People may draw their organizations as heirarchies, but that doesn't change that they are actually networks. Second, social complexity shows us that management is primarily about people and their relationships, not about departments and profits.

The main point about organizations being "networks" rather than "heirarchies" has to do with information flow; rather than being completely heirarchical (as it was in China), information can flow back and forth between all members of all levels.

- How do you prevent total chaos in this system?

> ...management heirarchy is a basic necessity (but nothing to brag about) and that the bulk of the work is done in a social network of peers: leaders and followers. Communication flows through the network. Authorization flows through the heirarchy.

Here's the beginning of an answer to the question I posed earlier. The author is separating "authorization" from "communication," stating that the former is a necessity of management and the latter is what drives productivity.

## Chapter 1: Why Things Are Not That Simple

"Complexity science," or the study of complex systems (mentioned in the preface), is defined here:

> Fortunately, science hasn't stood still since Kant's enthusiastic support of causal determinism. Dynamical systems theory, chaos theory, network theory, game theory, and several other branches of science have made great strides in explaining why some phenomena are unpredictable, and why many events simply cannot be planned or calculated and just have to be experience and observerd. The total body of scientific research into complex systems is sometimes collectively referred to as the complexity sciences.

**Causal determinism:** Any state, of an object or an event, is determined by prior states

So what we've gathered here is 1) development teams are complex systems and 2) the behavior complex systems are completely unpredictable.

- How do you manage them effectively?
