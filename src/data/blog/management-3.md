The notes I took for this book are LONG. Tons of highlights, in part due to lack of focus. The topic isn't so relevant to my current situation, so I didn't read it with any specific purpose in mind. And that shows. With that said though, it's a long book, and these notes *should* still serve as a good reference. Guess we'll see.

## Preface

> I saw that Agile software development was the practical implication of treating software teams and projects as complex systems

This basically sets up the entire book: exploring how to manage teams of developers by viewing the situation as a complex system, and then proceeding scientifically

> One important insight is that all organizations are networks. People may draw their organizations as heirarchies, but that doesn't change that they are actually networks. Second, social complexity shows us that management is primarily about people and their relationships, not about departments and profits.

The main point about organizations being "networks" rather than "heirarchies" has to do with information flow; rather than being completely heirarchical (as it was in China), information can flow back and forth between all members of all levels.

- How do you prevent total chaos in this system?

> ...management heirarchy is a basic necessity (but nothing to brag about) and that the bulk of the work is done in a social network of peers: leaders and followers. Communication flows through the network. Authorization flows through the heirarchy.

Here's the beginning of an answer to the question I posed earlier. The author is separating "authorization" from "communication," stating that the former is a necessity of management and the latter is what drives productivity.

## Chapter 1: Why Things Are Not That Simple

"Complexity science," or the study of complex systems (mentioned in the preface), is defined here:

> Fortunately, science hasn't stood still since Kant's enthusiastic support of causal determinism. Dynamical systems theory, chaos theory, network theory, game theory, and several other branches of science have made great strides in explaining why some phenomena are unpredictable, and why many events simply cannot be planned or calculated and just have to be experience and observerd. The tis sometimes collectively referred to as the complexity sciences.
otal body of scientific research into complex systems 
**Causal determinism:** Any state, of an object or an event, is determined by prior states

So what we've gathered here is 1) development teams are complex systems and 2) the behavior complex systems are completely unpredictable.

- So how do you manage them, as complex systems, effectively?

> The approach of deconstructing systems into their parts and analyzing how these parts interact to make up the whole is called reductionism. It is the idea that "phenomena can be explained completely in terms of other, more fundamental phenomena."

> Many people falsely believe that the reductionist hypothesis implies a "constructionist" one, which would say that any system can be constructed once we understand its parts. This is false because even if we fully understand all parts of a system, that doesn't mean that the whole is simply the sum of its parts. Knowledge of the lower-level parts doesn't imply our ability to reconstruct the higher-level system.

This is, where I assume, emergent properties come into play.

> The human brain is wired to assume that every event has an identifiable cause. This is called *causality and is useful for prediction and planning.* However, quite often things are more complex than they seem. Complexity science teaches...

This is a useful little tidbit about human nature to draw from. A takeaway from this point is to slow down and stay aware of fallacies in my own thought process––especially when dealing with complex systems (cf. *Thinking, Fast and Slow*).

> Although reductionism (understanding a system by understanding its parts) has been successful in science, it is now generally accepted that reductionism can be taken too far. For understanding many complex problems, a more holistic view is needed, which is hte goal of the study of social complexity. If offers a holistic view on whatever happens with groups of people. Management 3.0 is a model for Agile management, which applied complexity thinking to Agile software development teams.

Ah, so there it is: tying that quick crash course on complexity science into the core purpose of this book. Of course, I'm not going to be managing anyone anytime soon, but this book still has a lot to offer in terms of being able to analyze the way I'm being managed (could be nice), having a better understanding of the way teams interact (very relevent) and so on.

## Chapter 2: Agile Software Development

> Agile recognizes that people are unique individuals instead of replaceable resources and that their highest value is not in their heads but in their interactions and collaboration.

This is pretty interesting! Individuals' highest value being in their interactions. It's very heavily related to EQ, and how books like *Working with Emotional Intelligence* say that a worker's productivity is primarily determined by EQ. This is pretty much saying the same thing, but in the context of management and teams.

**The 7 dimensions of software projects:**
1. People
2. Functionality
3. Quality
4. Tools
5. Time
6. Value
7. Process

## Chapter 3: Complex Systems Theory

> Like Agile software development, complex systems theory favors a cross-disciplinary approach to problem solving. Complexity thinking is the antidote to specialization in science. It recognizes patterns in systems across all scientific disciplines and promotes problem solving involving concepts from different fields. But complexity theory has not been the first attempt at cross-breeding the sciences.

...the author proceeds to explain a bunch of other theories; dynamical systems theory (stable/unstable states), game theory, evolutionary theory, chaos theory, etc etc. These aren't alternatives to complexity theory; they're just examples of other theories that exist at the intersection of multiple fields.

There are lots of great and helpful images in this chapter that really help visualize the relationship between different disciplines and complexity theory... it's a bit of a pain to move them into these blog posts though.

## Chapter 4: The Information-Innovation System

> The complex systems approach says that innovation is not a planned result but an emergent result. However, for things to change there has to be something to emerge out of. This led me to identify the Five Cogs of Innovation, which are discussed next.

**The Five Cogs of Innovation (in order)**
1. Knowledge
2. Creativity
3. Motivation
4. Diversity
5. Personality

These 5 cogs, according to the author here, are what take you from information to innovation.

> One conclusion is becoming more and more evident: The primary focus of any manager should be to energize people, to make sure they actually want to do all that stuff. And doing all that stuff requires motivation.

As a corollary to this, any worker who wishes to do good by his/her manager and company should find self-motivation. For a young engineer with few prospects and who needs to keep his job, it's probably good advice.

> Diversity (officially: heterogeneity) in a complex system is important because the many benefits far outweigh the costs (of variation within the system). Scientists have found that diversity can stabilize a system and make it resilient to environmental changes. Diversity helps a system to survive in tough environments. It increases flexibility and feeds innovation.

This was probably the least obvious of the 5 cogs, so here's where the author clarifies a little bit. Basically he's saying that diversity in the evolutionary sense, where having a diverse gene pool makes people less likely to be completely wiped out by a disease, and diversity in the workplace, where you try to have a diverse set of backgrounds, are cut from the same cloth. From the same thread. Makes sense, too; if everyone on a team thinks the same way, then they're prone to all making the same mistake.

## Chapter 5: How to Energize People

**The three phases of creativity (according to AJ Cropley's model)**
1. Preconventional creativity: commonly exhibited by children younger than 7, it's mainly formed using visual perception and involves spontaneity and emotional involvement
2. Conventional creativity: usually found in kids 7 to 11 years old. Involves actual thinking, but constrained by the child's developing skills
3. Postconventional creativity: the last phase, found in older kids and adults. People in this phase can produce new things despite knowing what the constraints and conventional approaches are.

In other words, creativity in adults is all about being able to think outside the box, ignore constraints and conventional approaches and do something original. Basically.

> The path for managers is clear: When they care about organizational survival, they need to care about innovation. When they care about innovation, they need to care about creativity. When they care about creativity, they need to care about intrinsic motivation. It's almost like a Natural Law.

Self-determination theory is a general model of intrinsic motivation that differentiates between three main intrinsic needs. These needs are all universal, innate, and psychological, and they are:
1. Competence: the need for a person to experience oneself as capable in coping with the environment
2. Autonomy: the need for someone to actively participate in determining one's own behavior, with autonomous choice of actions
3. Relatedness: the need to care for and be related to others, and to be involved in the social world

These are all very relatable. Evidence towards what the author says about them being innate, universal, and psychological, I suppose. A relevant question to ask in my own life would be: can these be faked? Or, when these intrinsic motivations are not provided by external forces, is there any way to give them to myself? Probably. Most definitely. There are plenty of movies and TV shows and stuff about people who are constantly being told "no" and then find it in themselves to get that motivation and achieve what they want. There's a lot of power in that. At the same time, there are probably a lot more people who had that kind of manic self-motivation and still failed miserably. So... don't go too far? Listen to people? Luckily for me, as a young fella that's pretty easy for me to do. Pretty much everyone else knows better than I do. Regardless, I'm not reaching any conclusions hear––and I don't see that happening-–so I'm just going to move on. Definitely a thought-provoking section, though!

## Chapter 6: The Basics of Self-Organization

Emergent properties have three aspects:
1. They will no longer exist if you take away the individual parts of the system
2. They are not an aggregate––they are not a sum of the properties of individual parts
3. There is downward causality; the property influences the behavior of the individual parts

> The more complex a system is, the less we can control is. (And software projects can be complex.) Fortunately, there is a simple solution: Traffic controllers don't manage the aircraft. They let the pilots do that. Pilots hardly do any controlling themselves. Much of it is delegated to automated systems. And (wise) managers delegate most activites to team members. Delegation of control is a manager's way of controlling complex systems. You push decisions and responsibilities down to a level where someone has information that is smaller in size and more accurate... for better overall control of a complex system, most of the decisions should be made in the subsystems

## Chapter 7: How to Empower Teams

> We've seen two dimensions of empowering people: You can choose the necessary maturity level for empowerment, and you can choose the level of authority per task. A third dimension is the number of people you are going to involve for each task.

> By far the best thing you can do is to stop associating delegation with importance. Asking someone to do work for you does not make you more important. If you succeed in getting this perverse idea of importance out of people's heads, you probably own't even need to struggle with disrespectful behavior. Respecting people, and retaining them, should then come naturally to everyone.

## Chapter 8: Leading and Ruling on Purpose

> Seperating leadership from management is like comparing women to humans. It doesn't make sense. Comparing women to men seems more logical to me. Likewise, I think it makes more sense to compare leaders to rulers. Both are responsibilities, or behavioral styles, within the job that we call management.

Just an interesting little tidbit about the relationships between management, rulership, and leadership––at least, in the context of this book. It's pretty easy to get them tangled up.

> The purpose of something that emerges from the interacting parts is not determined by the purposes of those parts, but rather by the complex interaction between those parts. The goal of the brain is not a result of the goals of its neurons but of the interaction between the neurons. The goal of a city is not a result of the goals of its residents but of the interaction between the residents. The goal of a team is not a result of the goals of its team members but of the interaction between the team members.

## Chapter 9: How to Align Constraints

> A shared objective (extrinsic purpose) transcends any goals of individuals or teams within the group for which the manager is responsible, and therefore the corporate goal should also transcend the goal of the CEO. It is, literally, a "higher purpose" that the manager assigns to a whole group, intending it both as a directive and as a way to improve employee satisfaction.

When you've defined a set of goals, you could run them against this (ridiculously long) checklist. It was made by combining various sources.

- Is the goal specific and understandable enough so that people know what you mean? 
- Is the goal simple and concise enough so that it fits on a small card or sticky note? 
- Is the goal manageable and measurable so that success can be determined? 
- Is the goal memorable and reproducible so that people can easily communicate it to others?
- Is the goal attainable and realistic so that people have a chance of actually achieving it?
- Is the goal ambitious and stimulating enough so that it isn’t (too) easy to achieve?
- Is the goal actionable and assignable so that it can be turned into specific actions? 
- Is the goal agreed-upon and committable so that people actually feel responsibility for it? 
- Is the goal relevant and useful enough for people so that they really care about it?
- Is the goal time-bound and time-specific so that people know when to do it?
- Is the goal tangible and real so that people can see the effects of achieving it? 
- Is the goal excitable and igniting so that it motivates people to do their best?
- Is the goal inspiring and visionary so that it helps people to see a bigger picture?
- Is the goal value-based and fundamental so that it builds on top of company values, team values, or personal values?
- Is the goal revisitable and assessable so that you can reassess its applicability later?

Boy, that's long. In fact, the author goes on to say that "you simply have to pick a few criteria that you find important to your *current* situation".

**On Vision/Mission Statements**

> [Vision statements] are usually created for businesses, projects, and products. They are outward facing, dealing with the place a system has in the world and the change it will bring to its environment. Whereas mission statements are more commonly used for groups and teams. They are inward facing, steering the internal dynamics of a system. The vision is about a desired end state, and the mission iis about the way to get there.

That's a pretty cool insight about a distinction that I never gave any thought to.

**Summary**

A self-organizing team must have a *shared goal*, which can be assigned by their manager. The way this goal is defined depends on the context.

It's highly important that this goal is *not* connected to rewards and that it is communicated well

It's also wise to allow a team to define its own autonomous goal; if this happens, try to compromise on the assigned goal and the autonomous goal.

## Chapter 10: The Craft of Rulemaking

This chapter is the first half of "develop competence," the fourth view in the Management 3.0 model. It's a deeper look into the rule making process, which turns out to be not as straightforward as you'd think.

The **learning classifier system (LCS)** is a generic pattern for learning capabilities in complex adaptive systems. It has 3 parts:
1. The **performance system** has a number of stimulus-response rules, where the rules are meant to act upon messages received from the environment (or from other rules). These rules may conflict! Which is where things get messy... in a sense, the rules are competing as well as collaborating, and only the "fittest" rules get to contribute to the whole complex adaptive system
2. The **credit assignment** gives credit to those rules which seem to lead to improved performance of the entire system. Results that were detrimental have their strength reduced. This part ensures that *experience* is built up in the system
3. The **rule discovery** part is about finding new rules! In things like DNA, they come from recombinations of building blocks.

> The mistake naive managers make is that they directly try to "program" team members by giving them rules to follow... but the power of complex adaptive systems is that agents can manage their own rulemaking process.

### Summary
- The development of rules in a team is a matter of competence––basically, for a team to work, its members need to be competent (duh?)
- The subsidiary principle suggests that rules should be created at the level of the lowest competent authority

## Chapter 11: How to Develop Competence

**The Suboptimization Principle**: if each subsystem, regarded separately, is made to operate with maximum efficiency, the system as a whole will not operate with utmost efficiency.

In other words: *optimize the whole*. Measure the whole! This principle tells us that our metrics must cover the entire system, otherwise we will suboptimize. E.g. a focus on "working features delivered" or on "sprint demos accepted" or "bugs fixed" can lead to quality degradation, demotivation, etc.

The system will give you *what is measured*! If you're measuring a subsystem, you're going to miss other things. WYMIWYG. What you measure is what you get. You should try to have simple measures of all the 7 project dimensions (again: functionality, people, value, time, tools, money, process, and quality).

...this chapter then goes on to gives a bunch of tips and stuff about this.

## Chapter 12: Communication on Structure

This chapter is all about communication and how it's a 2-way street, yada yada. It defines different personality types when it comes to communication and other things like that. Important takeaways:

- Miscommunication in organizations is often the norm... to avoid this, communication requires proper feedback
- Optimizing communication ia all about tuning the connections between team members. There needs to be a nice balance struck between competition and cooperation
- The structure of an organization contributes heavily to optimal commmunication. Scaling out works better than scaling up.

## Chapter 13: How to Grow Structure

> Management heirarchies are like taxi drivers. They are both necessary and evil... evil because heirarchies are too easily abused, in which case they have terrible effects on information flow

Jordan Peterson mentions heirarchies a lot. At least, he did on Joe Rogan's podcast, I haven't seen his stuff outside of that. But he's very serious about heirarchies and their role in nature, evolution, society etc. They're super important, at least they have been.

> The purpose of organization is to reduce the ammount of communication and coordination necessary; hence organization is a radical attack on the communication problems... what we need is a happy marriage of the formal heirarchical structure with the informal network structure. Management must acknowledge that information flows through the network and not through the heirarchy.

In other words, heirarchies reduce the amount of communication and coordination necessary, which can be a big boost to productivity. But at a certain point, you lose the ability to effectively address communication problems. Hence, the need to meet somewhere in between in order to optimize communication.

## Chapter 14: The Landscape of Change

> The introduction of a system into an environment *changes* the environment.

In other words, the environment that a system experiences is not the same environment that would exist if the system wasn't there. That's why it's so hard to plan for the introduction of something new based on the current state of the environment.

> Success is the postponement of failure. Scientists have found that the ability of families of species to survive does not improve over geological time. From the fact that the risk of extinction in ecosystems has never dropped, it follows that species have never succeeded in becoming any better to avoid it. It seems as if the goal of evolving species is not to lower the chance of failure, but to change only when it is really necessary.

**Summary**

- An environment cannot be seen independent of the systems that inhabit it
- All products are doomed to fail; any success along the way is just a postponement of that failure


## Chapter 15: How to Improve Everything

> Here's what I think: The value of change is proportional to the pain that a person experiences when they are *not* changing. <br/><br/> Why are buildings reinforced *after* the latest earthquake? Why do I improve my dental care only *after* I lose a tooth? Why do I refactor my code only *after* I encounter touch design problems? Why do team members communicate better only *after* the customer hits them on their heads with a dead fish?

Fitness landscapes come up a lot in this chapter, and they're a really good way of looking at the fitness of a system––especially a super complex thing. They really highlight the idea that sometimes you have to take one step back to take to steps forward.

One way to navigate the fitness landscape, says the author, is simply to change it. That means purposefully changing the environment (customers, top management, etc) so that teams can better find their optimal performance.

## Chapter 16: All is Wrong, but Some Is Useful

There are 6 views to the management 3.0 model:
1. Energize people
2. Empower teams
3. Align constraints
4. Develop competence
5. Grow structure
6. Improve everything

**Summary**
- All practices for manager should contribute positively to at least one of those 6 views
- In the end, all models will fail... no model can paint a complete picture of copmlex systems like software projects. It's best to have multiple complementary and conflicting models for different occasions
- The same applies to software methods. Each is only useful in its proper context
