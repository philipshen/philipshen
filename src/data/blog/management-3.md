## Preface

> I saw that Agile software development was the practical implication of treating software teams and projects as complex systems

This basically sets up the entire book: exploring how to manage teams of developers by viewing the situation as a complex system, and then proceeding scientifically

> One important insight is that all organizations are networks. People may draw their organizations as heirarchies, but that doesn't change that they are actually networks. Second, social complexity shows us that management is primarily about people and their relationships, not about departments and profits.

The main point about organizations being "networks" rather than "heirarchies" has to do with information flow; rather than being completely heirarchical (as it was in China), information can flow back and forth between all members of all levels.

- How do you prevent total chaos in this system?

> ...management heirarchy is a basic necessity (but nothing to brag about) and that the bulk of the work is done in a social network of peers: leaders and followers. Communication flows through the network. Authorization flows through the heirarchy.

Here's the beginning of an answer to the question I posed earlier. The author is separating "authorization" from "communication," stating that the former is a necessity of management and the latter is what drives productivity.

## Chapter 1: Why Things Are Not That Simple

"Complexity science," or the study of complex systems (mentioned in the preface), is defined here:

> Fortunately, science hasn't stood still since Kant's enthusiastic support of causal determinism. Dynamical systems theory, chaos theory, network theory, game theory, and several other branches of science have made great strides in explaining why some phenomena are unpredictable, and why many events simply cannot be planned or calculated and just have to be experience and observerd. The tis sometimes collectively referred to as the complexity sciences.
otal body of scientific research into complex systems 
**Causal determinism:** Any state, of an object or an event, is determined by prior states

So what we've gathered here is 1) development teams are complex systems and 2) the behavior complex systems are completely unpredictable.

- So how do you manage them, as complex systems, effectively?

> The approach of deconstructing systems into their parts and analyzing how these parts interact to make up the whole is called reductionism. It is the idea that "phenomena can be explained completely in terms of other, more fundamental phenomena."

> Many people falsely believe that the reductionist hypothesis implies a "constructionist" one, which would say that any system can be constructed once we understand its parts. This is false because even if we fully understand all parts of a system, that doesn't mean that the whole is simply the sum of its parts. Knowledge of the lower-level parts doesn't imply our ability to reconstruct the higher-level system.

This is, where I assume, emergent properties come into play.

> The human brain is wired to assume that every event has an identifiable cause. This is called *causality and is useful for prediction and planning.* However, quite often things are more complex than they seem. Complexity science teaches...

This is a useful little tidbit about human nature to draw from. A takeaway from this point is to slow down and stay aware of fallacies in my own thought process––especially when dealing with complex systems (cf. *Thinking, Fast and Slow*).
