*Sidenote: it's taking me a lot longer than I thought it would to move these notes to my blog... I'll probably be playing catch up for a while*

This was a pretty great one! It was all about identifying and handling conversations that are high stakes, high pressure, etc.

## Chapter 1: What's a Crucial Conversation?

Crucial conversations have the following properties:
1. Opinions vary. There is conflict.
2. Stakes are high
3. Emotions run strong

When we are confronted with crucial conversations, we can do one of three things:
1. We can avoid them
2. We can face them and handle them poorly
3. We can face them and handle them well

Clearly, seeing as how by definition "the stakes are high," we'd want to go with option 3 here. To do that, we need to develop this skill for having crucial conversations.

> **The law of crucial conversations:** at the heart of almost all chronic problems in our organizations, our teams, and our relationships lie crucial conversations––ones that we're either not holding or not holding well. Twenty years of research involving more than 100,000 people reveals that the key skill of effective leaders, teammates, parents, and loved ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and politically risky issues. Period.

One takeaway from this is, exactly as a young person, it would be wise to not avoid those kinds of political/controversial discussions. It could be great practice for having crucial conversations

Most leaders attribute failures to issues of policy, process, structure, or system. When things don't work, they *restructure*. But the key to real change is in gettin gpeople to hold one another accountable *to* the process (or system, or whatever).

There are 3 types of people when it comes to crucial conversations:
1. Those who digress into threats and name-calling
2. Those who revert to silent fuming
3. Those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively

## Chapter 2: Masterint Crucial Conversations: The Power of Dialogue

When people are being steamrolled into making a bad decision by their boss, they often (wrongly) assume they have 2 alternative
1. Speak up, and make an enemy of their superior in the process
2. Suffer in silence and make a bad decision that might ruin the company

This is the "fool's choice" and it doesn't have to be this way; in order to get around this, you must ask (and answer) the question: "How can I be 100% honest, and at the same time be 100% respectful?"

**Step 1:** Getting all relevant information out into the open. At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information.

**Step 2:** Filling the "pool of shared meaning." You must make it safe for everyone to add information to the pool––even if their ideas seem controversial, wrong, or incompatible with other ideas. Just need to get everything out into the open.
- People can't agree to anything if they don't understand what they're agreeing to/with. Getting information out helps everyone reach a shared understanding.

The issue is, now, how do you make it safe for people to add information to the shared pool?
