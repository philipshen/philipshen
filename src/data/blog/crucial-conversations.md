*Sidenote: it's taking me a lot longer than I thought it would to move these notes to my blog... I'll probably be playing catch up for a while*

This was a pretty great one! It was all about identifying and handling conversations that are high stakes, high pressure, etc.

## Chapter 1: What's a Crucial Conversation?

Crucial conversations have the following properties:
1. Opinions vary. There is conflict.
2. Stakes are high
3. Emotions run strong

When we are confronted with crucial conversations, we can do one of three things:
1. We can avoid them
2. We can face them and handle them poorly
3. We can face them and handle them well

Clearly, seeing as how by definition "the stakes are high," we'd want to go with option 3 here. To do that, we need to develop this skill for having crucial conversations.

> **The law of crucial conversations:** at the heart of almost all chronic problems in our organizations, our teams, and our relationships lie crucial conversations––ones that we're either not holding or not holding well. Twenty years of research involving more than 100,000 people reveals that the key skill of effective leaders, teammates, parents, and loved ones is the capacity to skillfully address emotionally and politically risky issues. Period.

One takeaway from this is, exactly as a young person, it would be wise to not avoid those kinds of political/controversial discussions. It could be great practice for having crucial conversations

Most leaders attribute failures to issues of policy, process, structure, or system. When things don't work, they *restructure*. But the key to real change is in gettin gpeople to hold one another accountable *to* the process (or system, or whatever).

There are 3 types of people when it comes to crucial conversations:
1. Those who digress into threats and name-calling
2. Those who revert to silent fuming
3. Those who speak openly, honestly, and effectively

## Chapter 2: Mastering Crucial Conversations: The Power of Dialogue

When people are being steamrolled into making a bad decision by their boss, they often (wrongly) assume they have 2 alternative
1. Speak up, and make an enemy of their superior in the process
2. Suffer in silence and make a bad decision that might ruin the company

This is the "fool's choice" and it doesn't have to be this way; in order to get around this, you must ask (and answer) the question: "How can I be 100% honest, and at the same time be 100% respectful?"

**Step 1:** Getting all relevant information out into the open. At the core of every successful conversation lies the free flow of relevant information.

**Step 2:** Filling the "pool of shared meaning." You must make it safe for everyone to add information to the pool––even if their ideas seem controversial, wrong, or incompatible with other ideas. Just need to get everything out into the open.
- People can't agree to anything if they don't understand what they're agreeing to/with. Getting information out helps everyone reach a shared understanding.

The issue is, now, how do you make it safe for people to add information to the shared pool? *That's* the key to skill in dialogue; making it safe for everyone to add their own ideas.

**People can buy into ideas they *understand*.**

## Chapter 3: Start with Heart

This chapter is all about the *how* of dialogue: *how* do you encourage the flow of meaning in the face of differing opinions and strong emotions?

The first principle of dialogue: **start with heart**––your *own* heart.

> Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It's that our motives do––a fact that we usually miss.

In other words, sometimes our motives change––for example, we forget what we *really* want out of a conversation and instead start trying to insult somebody––and we don't even notice. You have to be able to realize this and stay on track.

> Skilled people Start with Heart. That is, they begin high-risk discussions with the right motives, and they stay focused no matter what happens.

> When under attack, our heart can take a [] sudden and unconscious turn. When faced with pressure and strong opinions, we often stop worrying about the goal of adding to the pool of meaning and start looking for ways to win, punish, or keep the peace.

Consider:
- What do I really want for myself?
- What do I really want for others?
- What do I really want for the relationship?
- How would I behave if I really wanted those results?

You can break free of the fool's choice by searching for the *and*.

## Chapter 4: Learn to Look

> I watch the content of the conversation (the topic under discussion) along with the conditions (what people are doing in response). I look for and examine both *what* and *why*. If you can see why people are becoming upset or holding back their views or even going silent, you can do something to get back on track.

This is the key (and obviously a not-so-easy skill) to fixing conversations that start to go sour! You have to be able to identify why. This is what this chapter is about.

> It helps to watch for three different conditions: the moment a conversation turns crucial, signs that people don't feel safe (silence or violence), and your own Style Under Stress.

**You have to look for safety problems**

When it's safe, you can say anything. Fear kills flow of meaning like nothing else.

The authors claim here that "people rarely become defensive simply because of *what* you're saying. They only become defensive when they no longer feel safe. The problem is not the *content* of your message, but the *condition* of the conversation.

When people become unsafe, they start down one of two unhealthy paths: **silence** (witholding meaning from the pool) or **violence** (trying to force meaning into the pool).

It's important to look for your own style under stress! Often you don't look for them and they slip right past you. Becoming a vigilant self-monitor is the first step.

## Chapter 5: Make it Safe

The last chapter was about spotting safety risks. This one is about making it safe.

**Mutual Purpose**: The first condition of safety. Mutual Purpose means that other perceive that you're working toward a common outcome in the conversation, that you care about their goals, interests, and values, and vice versa.

Mutual purpose is very important to having a healthy conversation, and you should always make sure it's safe. Here are two questions to help determine if it's at risk:

- Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation?
- Do they trust my motives?

### Skills related to mutual purpose

**Apologize**

> An apology isn't really an apology unless you experience a change in heart. To offer a sincere apology, your motives have to change. You have to give up saving face, being right, or winning in order to focus on what you *really* want.

**Contrast**

Sometimes people feel disrespected even if you haven't done anything disrespectful. When people misinterpret your purpose or intent, you can rebuild safety through *contrasting*.

> Contrasting is a don't/do statement that 1) addresses others' concerns that you don't respect them or that you have a malicious purpose (don't) and 2) confirms your respect or clarifies your real purpose (do)

**Create Mutual Purpose**

Sometimes you're in the middle of the debate because you have clearly different purposes. In this case, you have to be able to create a mutual purpose by moving toward a compromise. Stick with the acronym CRIB

- **C**: Commit to seek mutual purpose. You have to agree to agree; this requires you to act on faith that if you build more safety, the other person will feel more confident in dialogue.

*"It seems like we're both trying to force our view on each other. I commit to stay in this discussion until we have a solution that satisfies both of us."*

- **R**: Recognize the purpose behind the strategy. You need to know the other person's purpose! 

*"You want peace and quiet, and I want time with you away from the kids. So if we can come up with something that is quiet and away, we'll both be happy. Is that right?"*

- **I**: Invent a mutual purpose. Find an objective that is meaningful to both parties, and shift the conversation there. Moving to higher, longer-term goals can transcend short-term compromises

- **B**: Brainstorm new strategies. Think outside the box for other alternatives. Be willing to give creativity a try for the sake of finding a mutually acceptable option.

## Chapter 6: Master My Stories

- Emotions don't settle upon you like a gof. They are not foisted upon you by others. No matter how comfortable it might make you feel saying it––other don't *make you mad*. You make you mad. You make you scared, annoyed, or insulted. You and only you create your emotions.
- Once you've created your upset emotions, you have only two options: You can act on them or be acted on by them. That is, when it comes to strong emotions, you either find a way to master them or fall hostage to them

**Your emotions are not the only valid response, despite the fact that they feel justified and accurate.**

> The *best* at dialogue... act *on* their emotions. that is, when they have strong feelings, they influence (and often change) their emotions by *thinking them out*.

**Stories**
- Even if you don't realize it, you are telling yourself stories
- Storytelling can happen blindingly fast. You may not notice
- Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories
- If you take control of your stories, they won't control you.

### Skills for Mastering Our Stories

#### Retrace Your Path

- ACT: Notice your behavior. "Am I in some form of siilence or violence?"
- FEEL: Get in touch with your feelings. "What emotions are encouraging me to act this way?"
- TELL STORY: Analyze your stories. "What story is creating these emotions?"
- SEE/HEAR: Get back to the facts. "What evidence do I have to support this story?"

This kind of "observation" advice pops up all the time in these self-help books. They're all talking about the same thing: self-awareness. It's very important.

#### Notice Your Behavior

Basically, now that you've observed what you're *thinking*, pay attention to what you are *doing*.

#### Get in Touch with Your Feelings

> Identifying your emotions is more difficult than you might imagine. In fact, many people are emotionally illiterate. When asked to describe how they're feeling, they use words such as "bad" or "angry" or "frightened"––which would be okay if these were accurate descriptors, but often they're not. Individuals say they're angry when, in fact, they're feeling a mix of embarrassment and surprise. Or they suggest they're unhappy when they'e feeling violated. Perhaps they suggest they're upset when they're really feeling humiliated and cheated.

TL;DR: Getting in touch with your feelings consistently requires a good emotional vocabulary.

#### Analyze Your Stories

> The first step to regaining emotional control is to challenge the illusion that what you're feeling is the only *right* emotion under the circumstances.

Don't confuse stories with facts! Sometimes you fail to question your stories because you see them as immutable facts.

#### Get Back to the Facts

> Separate fact from story by focusing on behavior. To separate fact from story, get back to the genuine source of your feelings. Test your ideas against a simple criterion: Can you *see* or *hear* this thing you're calling a fact? Was it an actual behavior?

> Spot the story by watching for "hot" words. Here's another tip. To avoid confusing story with fact, watch for "hot" terms. For example, when assessing the facts, you might say, "She scowled at me" or "He made a sarcastic comment." Words such as "scowl" and "sarcastic" are hot terms. They express judgements and attributions that, in turn, create strong emotions.

#### Watch for Three "Clever" Stories

> Either our stories are completely accurate and propel us in healthy directions, or they're quite inaccurate but justify our current behavior––making us feel good about ourselves and calling for no need to change.

The second one is bad! And generally those kinds of stories are told in three predictable ways.

1. Victim stories, "it's not my fault"
2. Villian stories, "it's all your fault"
3. Helpless stories, "there's nothing else I can do"

Generally, they match reality, get us off the hook, and keep us from acknowledging our own sellouts. Need to get past them in order to improve!

#### Tell the Rest of the Story

> A useful story, by definition, creates emotions that lead to healthy action––such as dialogue.

## Chapter 7: STATE My Path

This chapter is all about speaking persuasively and not abraisively.

- Share your facts
- Tell your story
- Ask for others' paths
- Talk tentavely
- Encourage testing

The first three skills describe *what* to do. The last two tell *how* to do it.
