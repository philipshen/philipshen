The best band in the business for chill, Californian vibes! I’ve driven many a car on many a sunny California day listening to Weezer, never gets old. They’re like the Beach Boys but more Rock n’ Roll. They’re also very consistent in their production of rockers (hence their floor being an “8”); the only album I didn’t like was the Red Album.

Weezer is definitely more of a song-band than an album-band. So the "best album" stuff is hard to get, because the real answer is just their greatest hits albums.

**Best Album:** *White Album*
Well, it’s the most “chill and Californian” album, so no surprise here really. I don’t see a lot of love for this album on the internet though, which is kind of a shame.

**Best Songs**

There are too many “very good songs” of theirs to make a good list (which is why their floor is an 8). So this is way too hard. While I am kind of sure that *Perfect Situation* is my favorite, I’m going to have to list a bunch in no particular order. The following songs are all around the “9” mark, though.

*Perfect Situation*, *Buddy Holly*, *The Sweater Song*, *Say It Ain’t So*, *Mexican Fender*. Some more too that I can't remember right now. Oh well, I'll just leave it at that.
